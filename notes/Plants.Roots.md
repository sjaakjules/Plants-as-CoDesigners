Images and notes taken from [The global biogeography of roots](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/0012-9615%282002%29072%5B0311%3ATGBOR%5D2.0.CO%3B2?casa_token=f6aZXMa4rsIAAAAA%3Ahgrda-dXbkur7NrL175oIs6JB5RKUpyIxQ341JGSmcHPeyMIBR7PHtczOLCNNPWFfDJXURMVsTdJ5g).

A century since the groundbreaking work of Schimper (1898) on “plant geography upon a physiological basis,” ecologists have made substantial progress in understanding the factors that shape the global distribution of vegetation and its aboveground structure (e.g., Box 1981, Woodward 1987, Prentice et al. 1992, Neilson 1995). The factors that control the biogeography of belowground vegetation structure remain less clear. For example, climate, soil characteristics, and plant life-forms are all likely to be important, but quantifying that importance at regional and global scales is difficult.

Vegetation types differ in root biomass, root turnover, vertical root distributions, and maximum rooting depth (Stone and Kalisz 1991, Canadell et al. 1996, Jackson et al. 1996, 1997, Vogt et al. 1996, Cairns et al. 1997).These properties influence the fluxes of water, carbon, and soil nutrients and the distribution and activity of soil fauna. Roots transport nutrients and water upwards, but they are also pathways for carbon and nutrient transport into deeper soil layers and for deep water infiltration (Johnston et al. 1983, Meek et al. 1992, Smith et al. 1999, Jobbágy and Jackson 2000, 2001). Roots also affect the weathering rates of soil minerals (Bormann et al. 1998).

Of all the biotic and abiotic factors examined, climate explained the largest proportion of global variation in rooting depths (Table 7). A large part of that variation correlated strongly with climatic variables that characterize supply and evaporative demand for water. Differences in life-forms between sites accounted for the next largest proportion of the observed variation. This proportion may also be due in part to climate, because differences in the life-form dominance of ecosystems are driven in part by climatic factors (Woodward 1987, Box 1996). Differences in soils explained very little of the variation in rooting depths globally, but this may be due in part to a lack of detailed information on soil characteristics. They were quite important for results within ecosystems or vegetation types (Fig. 8).

One interesting finding of this study is that 50% of all roots are within 30 cm (mean 18 ± 1 cm) of the soil surface (or the surface of the organic horizon, where present) in 85% of all profiles examined. In no profile would it have been necessary to dig deeper than 80 cm to sample 50% of all roots. Moreover root densities are highest in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile, including organic horizons, in ∼95% of all profiles. Several factors probably contribute to these patterns. Surface layers generally contain the highest concentrations of N, P, and K globally (Sposito 1989, Jobbágy and Jackson 2001). Oxygen deficiencies are also least likely in shallow soil layers. Our data show that ecosystems with thick organic horizons tend to have higher concentrations of roots in these horizons, most likely because they store nutrients and have large water-holding capacities. The high concentrations of roots in these organic layers lead to relatively shallow overall rooting depths.

Only ∼6% of all profiles in the database had lower root densities in the upper 20 cm of the profile than in the interval from 20 cm to 40 cm. Of these, more than four-fifths were in deserts, savanna, grasslands, or dry forests with at least one arid month during the growing season (mean 6.1 ± 0.7 mo). These are ecosystems where the upper soil horizons are likely to be too dry for resource uptake during part of the growing season.

For predictions on a global scale it may be undesirable to assign fixed rooting depths to life-forms or to simple life-form dominance classes, such as grasslands, shrublands, or forests. In our analysis, 95% rooting depths were more strongly related to climatic variables than to life-form dominance classes (Table 7). For example, grasslands were on average more deeply rooted in tropical regions than in temperate ones.
