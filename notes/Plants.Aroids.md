orchard bees collect scents.

usually females collect oil and pollen to make brood cells and line the cell wall.
for male, little is known. they collect scents. a fatty secretion in their mouth absorbes the smells. typically bees spit on their legs and then rub the flower to absorb the scent. but oil bees cant make that fatty saliva. instead they go to oil orchards and scrape the oil with their legs and rub on their belly.
