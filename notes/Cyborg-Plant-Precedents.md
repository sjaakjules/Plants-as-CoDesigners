## Plant Cyberspaces

**Other Intelligences**

![Other Intelligences](/assets/images/OtherIntelligences.png){max-height: 300px}

[Other Intelligences](http://interspeciesdialogues.net/) is a network of pot plants across the world. The pot plants are augmented with sensors and actuators. The sensors detect environmental changes such as soil moisture, light levels, temperature, noise and proximity. While the actuators vibrate the plant, create coloured light and sounds. The sensors within one plant communicate to the other plants around the world, creating a network which is observable to both the plant and the human.

The following is taken from Maria Castellanos' website which details a series of experimental projects that are centred around cyborg interactions with plants.

- [Clorofila 3.0 (2010-2015)](http://www.mariacastellanos.net/?/=/seccion/projects/entrada/clorofila) researches the electric impulses produced by plant organisms. A program specifically created for the project, it captures the changes in the voltage to reflect the state of the plant by translating them to sound in real time through a module set up inside the organism.
- [Symbiotic Interaction (2016-2017)](http://www.mariacastellanos.net/?/=/seccion/projects/entrada/symbiotic_engl) consists of two wearables that allow the user to measure and monitor their environment through the platens that are integrated into them. The plants are connected to sensors capable of capturing the changes produced in their environment. These are translated into modifications in colors, sounds, and graphics, with the wearable wearer can observe. While humans obtain information from their environment through vegetation, they offer their CO2 to plants in return.
- [The Plants Sense 2018](http://www.mariacastellanos.net/?/=/seccion/projects/entrada/plants_sense_eng) consists of an interactive garden in which different sensors measure the electrical oscillations of the connected plants, and show their biochemical reactions to the human presence and the environment that surrounds them via vibrations and low frequency sounds.
- [Beyond Human Perception 2020](http://www.mariacastellanos.net/?/=/seccion/projects/entrada/bhp_eng) is an installation that visualises the reactions of humans (EEG registered wave) and plants (electrical oscillations) to a common stimulus, music.

**terra0**

![terra0](/assets/images/terra0.png){max-height: 300px}

The following is taken from terra0 website and detail a series of experimental projects that are centred around the tokenization and verification of natural commodities.

- [Flowertokens (2018)](https://flowertokens.terra0.org) allows users to buy, trade, and speculate on tokenized Dahlias (Dahlia x Hortensis) via an online marketplace. The state of the individual tokens is automatically updated according to the different phases of their corresponding plant’s growth.
- [Premna Daemon (2018)](https://terra0.medium.com/premna-daemon-an-introduction-via-a-history-of-autonomy-in-the-cryptosphere-3cee15e92fe2) consists of a Bonsai tree (a Premna Microphylla), a web interface, several sensors and cameras, and a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Mainnet. When Premna itself requests assistance, users can donate Ethereum tokens to care for the various needs of the Premna Daemon (watering, lighting, leaf trimming, etc).
- [Two Degrees NFT (2021)](https://terra0.medium.com/two-degrees-nft-5af1263bfcc) is an NFT that burns "itself" when the average global temperature reaches 2°C above average.
- [Seed Capital (2022)](https://terra0.medium.com/wen-growth-an-introduction-to-seed-capital-8d4a9df93789) follows on from Premna Daemon. This installation is a sculpture that suggests ways to rethink the economic and ecological relationships between viewers, the institution and the artwork. It consists of a crypto-contract that attempts to mint NFTs at regular intervals. The minting is successful when the plant's soil moisture and temperature are within ideal conditions.
