## Extinction Plants Coding

1 are most rare
5 most common

G prefix is global
S is sub-national in america

G1 / G2 / G3 are endangered.

## Process of extinction

Loose the periphery of a species means you often loose genetic alleles and then collapse throughout the rest of the range as climate change moves through.

Wide spread species are death by 1000 cuts, stream channelisation, rip wrapping of shorelines, fertilisation

60% extinctions in america are single site endemics.

for conservation do you work for big landscape or small single sites?

Conservation: What is it? where is it? how is it doing it?

common names, more vernacular names.
What good is re-naming with less specificity?
what harm is it?

- missleading, one species has multiple names depending on area
- too many plants to go the common name route.
- most useful to humans get a common name, other less known plants dont get a name

## Single specimens

Quercus tardifolia - recently re-discovered.
Vanacular name: late leafed oak. (quercus -> oak; tardi -> late; folia -> leaf)

the habitat in big bend has changed around it. it is an ancient rellic. fire regimes, moisture is different. nursing it back in situ is not feasble. so taking clones and growing ex situ.

wildlife -> wild life should include plants. and the fedral re-definition can give more funding to conerve plants. currently it is focused on animals.

## Extinction Garden

You don't know it until you grow it.

- vegetatively,
- phenology,
- characters to tell it apart

why gardens are beneficial

- bridges the gap between ex situ and in situ
- oco plants (one )
- reaches the public

extinct from the wild.
